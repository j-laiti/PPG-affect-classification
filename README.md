# PPG-affect-classification
This repository includes the code to process PPG signals using a lightweight pipeline outlined in "Real-World Classification of Student Stress and Fatigue Using Wearable PPG Signals".

This includes the following sections:
1. A processing pipeline which can be applied to PPG datasets such as the open-source WESAD dataset or custom datasets.
2. A machine learning classification process that can be used to train classification models for PPG data containing affect state labels.
3. An analysis of the classification results including comuptational time, demographic biases, and explainability analysis using Shapley values.
