## PPG-affect-classification
This repository includes the code to process PPG signals using a lightweight pipeline outlined in "Real-World Classification of Student Stress and Fatigue Using Wearable PPG Signals".

## Repository Structure

This includes the following sections:

1. **Source code** in the `src` folder with:
   - Detailed processing pipeline functions in the `preprocessing` folder
   - Dataset-specific processing scripts in the `feature_extraction` folder

2. **Example scripts** used to generate the tables and figures in the manuscript

3. **Results tables** in the 'results' folder:
   - outcomes of the example scripts and tables presented in the manuscript within a folder for each dataset

## Getting Started
